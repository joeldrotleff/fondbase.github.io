    Melt 2 sticks butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes. :b, 2010-01-01, 5d
    Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. :b1, after b, 1d
    Transfer to a medium bowl, whisk in 1 ice cube, transfer to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes, whisking occasionally. :e1, after b, 20d
    Meanwhile, whisk together 10oz (~2 cups) flour, 3/4tsp baking soda, and 2tsp kosher salt (or 1tsp table salt) in a large bowl. :e, after b1, 5d
    Place 5oz (~3/4 cup) granulated sugar, 2 eggs, and 2tsp vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. :e2, after b1, 5d
    Whisk on medium-high speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes. :f, after e2, 5d
    Fit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges), add 5oz (~1/2 cup + 2tbsp) brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in stand mixer.:g, after e1 f, 2d
    Mix on medium speed to combine, about 15 seconds. :h, after g, 1d
    Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until just barely combined, with some dry flour still remaining, about 15 seconds. :h1, after e h, 1d
    Add 8oz chocolate (chips or chunks) and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 15 seconds longer. :h2, after h1, 1d
    Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate dough at least overnight and up to 3 days. :h3, after h2, 720d
section baking
    When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 325Â°F. :i, after h3, 10d
    Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop or a spoon, place scoops of cookie dough onto a nonstick or parchment-lined baking sheet. Each ball should measure approximately 3 tablespoons in volume, and you should be able to fit 6 to 8 balls on each sheet. :j, after h3, 2d
    Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface, then stick them back together with the rough sides facing outward. :k, after j, 1d
    Transfer to oven. :l, after k, 1d
    Bake until golden brown around edges but still soft, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through baking. :crit, m, after l h, 13d
section assemble
    Remove baking sheets from oven. While cookies are still hot, sprinkle very lightly with coarse salt and gently press salt down to embed. Let cool for 2 minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. :z, after m, 2d
    Repeat with remaining cookie dough. Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight container, plastic bag, or cookie jar at room temperature for up to 5 days. :zz, after z, 1d
